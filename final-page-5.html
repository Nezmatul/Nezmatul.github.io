        <h1>Andrew Haupert</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I am a junior at Lawrenceburg High School, where I currently hold the top rank in my class. I work hard to maintain a 4.31 weighted GPA, and I’m grateful for the opportunities my school has given me to learn, grow, and contribute.</p>   
        <br>
        <p>I’m involved in the high school’s sound department, where I help support the technical needs of school events and performances. I also participate in Academic Team and have had the chance to compete at the state level, which has helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and learn from students across the region.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I created this tutoring website to make it easier for students to connect with the academic support they need. My goal is simply to provide a helpful, organized platform that brings together qualified tutors and the students who can benefit from their guidance.</p>
